# Playwright Test Hanging Error

**Error:** Playwright test is hanging and eventually timing out with the error `page.goto: net::ERR_ABORTED; maybe frame was detached?`

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Created a basic test:** Created a simple Playwright test that navigates to the `/` path and verifies that the page loads successfully.
2.  **Increased timeout:** Increased the timeout for the test to 30 seconds.
3.  **Checked application status:** Tried to use the `web_read` tool to check if the application was running before navigating to the `/` path, but the `web_read` tool was not available in the test environment.
4.  **Simplified the test:** Removed the `expect` statement and just navigated to the `/` path.
5.  **Checked Playwright configuration:** Verified that the Playwright browsers were installed.
6.  **Verified application is running:** Ensured the application was running in the background before running the test.

**Possible Causes:**

*   Issue with Playwright configuration or environment.
*   The application is not starting correctly or is not accessible to the Playwright test.
*   Some other unknown issue with the test environment.

**Next Steps:**

*   Investigate the Playwright configuration and environment.
*   Verify that the application is starting correctly and is accessible to the Playwright test.
*   Try running the test with different Playwright configurations or environments.
*   Consult the Playwright documentation or community for assistance.
