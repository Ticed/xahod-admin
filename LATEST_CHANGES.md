*   **Initial Task:** Migrate an old dashboard into xahod-admin using shadcn-vue.

*   **Exploration:**
    *   Read the `README.md` and `README_TO_IMPLEMENT.md` files in the `extracted-app` folder to understand the business service and logic of the old admin dashboard.
    *   Explored the `new_ui_framework_shadcn_vue` directory to understand how shadcn-vue components are used in this project.
    *   Examined the `Example.vue` file in the `dashboard` example to understand how a dashboard is implemented using shadcn-vue components.

*   **Implementation:**
    *   Created a basic layout for the new dashboard with main routes using the `Tabs` component in `Dashboard.vue`.
    *   Updated the `App.vue` file to use the new `Dashboard.vue` file.
    *   Encountered issues with resolving component imports.
    *   Moved component files from `new_ui_framework_shadcn_vue/src/examples/dashboard/components` to `src/examples/dashboard/components`.
    *   Updated import statements in `Dashboard.vue` and other components to point to the new locations.
    *   Installed the `reka-ui` library, a dependency of the `Tabs` component.
    *   Configured Vite to correctly resolve component imports by modifying `vite.config.ts`.

*   **Testing:**
    *   Attempted to create and run a simple Playwright test to load the homepage.
    *   Encountered various issues with the test environment, including missing dependencies and incorrect configurations.
    *   Documented the troubleshooting steps in `troubleshooting.md`.

*   **Git Operations:**
    *   Added all changes to a git commit and pushed them to the remote repository.
